// In each case the room CAS flips replyMode='open' and the turnState is
// cleared; the caller emits one sys event per fallback so participants
// see what happened.

// see the same expired deadline and both write). The state writes are
// idempotent, but the caller emits one sys message per returned skip and
// fallback — so two concurrent sweeps of the same dead-end would post the
// "falling back to open mode" notice (and the moderator skip) TWICE. The
// fallback emission is therefore gated on `claimDeadEndNotice`: only the
// sweep that wins the SET NX claim returns the fallback; the loser
// suppresses it (state still converges via the winner's write).
